        <ol> 
            <li><strong>Brown Chuck Roast Steak:</strong> Heat up Instant Pot using "Sauté More" function. Wait until the Instant Pot says HOT. *Pro Tip: Make sure Instant Pot is as hot as it can be in order to induce a Maillard reaction.
                First, pat dry the chuck roast steaks, then season one side with salt and black pepper.
                Drizzle the inner pot with 1 tbsp olive oil. Ensure to coat the oil over the whole bottom of the pot.
                Carefully place the seasoned side of chuck steaks in Instant Pot. Then, season the other side with salt and black pepper. Brown one side for 7 minutes before flipping over, then brown the other side for another 7 minutes. Remove chuck steaks and set aside in a large container.</li>
            <li><strong>Saute Onion and Herbs:</strong> Add in sliced onions and minced shallot, then saute for 3 minutes. Add in minced garlic, sliced ginger, lemongrass, 3 star anise, 3 cloves, 2 bay leaf, 1 stick cinnamon, and ½ tsp fennel seeds, then saute for another minute. Add in 3 tbsp (50ml) tomato paste, then saute for another minute.</li>
            <li><strong>Deglaze Instant Pot:</strong> Pour in ½ cup (125ml) unsalted chicken stock, then deglaze by scrubbing all the flavorful brown bits off the bottom with a wooden spoon. Give it a quick mix.</li>
            <li><strong>Pressue Cook Bo Kho:</strong>Turn off the Instant Pot. Cut the browned chuck roast steaks into 1.5 inches thick cubes.
                Add 1 cup (250ml) unsalted chicken stock, 1 tbsp (15ml) fish sauce, 1 tbsp (15ml) regular soy sauce, and ½ tsp fine salt to the Instant Pot. Give it a quick mix.
                Place chuck roast cubes in the cooking liquid. *Pro Tip: Make sure the cubes are partially soaked in the liquid. Don't forget the meat juice!
                Layer the carrot chunks on top.

            <li><strong>Season Bo Kho:</strong> Bring the yummy Bo Kho sauce mixture to a simmer with the "Saute More" function. Taste and adjust the seasoning by adding more salt (roughly 1 - 2 large pinches of salt) and 1 tbsp (15ml) fish sauce (if necessary).</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Let the Instant Pot Bo Kho sits for another 10 - 20 minutes before serving. Garnish your delicious Vietnamese Beef Stew with cilantro and serve! Enjoy!~</li>
